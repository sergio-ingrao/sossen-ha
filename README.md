# SOSSEN Microinverter - Home Assistant Integration

Local integration for **SOSSEN 2in1-DE** microinverters (600W / 800W / 1000W) for Home Assistant.

Direct communication over the **local network** via Tuya v3.5 protocol — no cloud, no delays, no external servers.

## What it does

This integration reads production data directly from the SOSSEN microinverter and exposes them as sensors in Home Assistant, updating every 10 seconds (configurable).

### Available sensors

| Sensor | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------|------|
| DC Total Power | Combined power from both panels | W |
| AC Power | Inverter output power (fed to grid) | W |
| AC Voltage | Grid voltage | V |
| AC Frequency | Grid frequency | Hz |
| DC Voltage 1 / 2 | Input voltage from each panel | V |
| DC Current 1 / 2 | Input current from each panel | A |
| DC Power 1 / 2 | Power from each panel | W |
| Total Energy | Cumulative energy counter (odometer style) | kWh |
| Temperature | Inverter internal temperature | C |
| Inverter Status | Operating state: producing / alarm / off | — |

### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Power Limit | Set the output power limit (500-1000W) |
| Daytime Only | Enable/disable polling only during daylight hours |

### Diagnostics

| Sensor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Raw Data | Shows all raw register (DP) values as attributes |

## Supported models

- **SOSSEN 2in1-DE 600W**
- **SOSSEN 2in1-DE 800W** (tested)
- **SOSSEN 2in1-DE 1000W** (software upgrade of the same hardware)

Potentially compatible with other SOSSEN microinverters using the Tuya v3.5 protocol with proprietary Base64 payload. If you have a different model and it works (or doesn't), please open an issue!

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or higher
- The inverter must be on the same local network as Home Assistant
- Required: **Device ID**, **local IP**, and **Local Key**

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** → three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/sergioingrao/sossen-ha` as type **Integration**
4. Search for "SOSSEN" and install
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** → search for "SOSSEN"

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/sossen/` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** → search for "SOSSEN"

## Configuration

During setup you will be asked for:

| Field | Where to find it |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Device IP** | Check the DHCP client list in your router |
| **Device ID** | Smart Life app → your inverter → Settings (gear icon top right) → Device Information → Virtual ID |
| **Local Key** | [Tuya IoT Platform](https://iot.tuya.com) → create a project → link your Smart Life account → Devices → All Devices → Local Key |

### How to obtain the Local Key

1. Go to [iot.tuya.com](https://iot.tuya.com) and create an account
2. Create a new Cloud project (Data Center: Europe, or your region)
3. Under **Devices** → **Link Tuya App Account** → scan the QR code from the Smart Life app
4. Go to **Devices → All Devices** — you will find your inverter with its **Local Key**

> **Tip**: It is recommended to configure a static IP for the inverter in your router, so it doesn't change on reboot.

## How it works

The integration uses [TinyTuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya) to communicate directly with the inverter over the local network. The Tuya v3.5 protocol is used with `updatedps()` commands to trigger a response from the inverter, which sends a proprietary Base64 payload containing all production data.

The payload is decoded according to the SOSSEN format: 2-byte header + 6-byte records, where each record contains the register ID (DP) and its associated value.

### Important technical note

The SOSSEN inverter accepts **only one connection** at a time. If you have other software connecting to the same inverter (e.g. Python scripts, tuya-local, etc.), you must disable them before using this integration.

## Recommended dashboard

For an animated energy flow dashboard, install [Power Flow Card Plus](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus) from HACS.

If you have a SOSSEN inverter with a different model, your raw data (from the "Raw Data" diagnostic sensor) is valuable for mapping new registers!
