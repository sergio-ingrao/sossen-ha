Local integration for **SOSSEN 2in1** (600W / 800W / 1000W) and **SOSSEN 4in1** (2400W) microinverters.

Direct communication over the local network — no cloud, no delays.

## Features

* Real-time solar production sensors (power, voltage, current, frequency, temperature, energy) — per-panel channels included
* **Inverter status** with 3 states: producing, alarm, off
* **Power limit control** directly from HA (500 W up to the model maximum)
* **Automatic on/off detection** from the network (battery systems producing at night are supported): when off, power drops to 0, unmeasurable values go unavailable, the energy counter is preserved
* **Diagnostic sensor** with all raw register values
* Updates every **10 seconds** (configurable)
* Compatible with HA **Energy Dashboard**
* Available in **English, Italian, German and French**
